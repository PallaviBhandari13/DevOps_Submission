# DevOps_Submission
A company has a main developer and has hired a junior developer recently. The website of the company is running well. The owner wants some updations in the website and has assigned the task to the newly hired developer. But, he doesn't want that if by any chance the new developer makes any mistake and the website goes down. Also, the work done by the new developer has to be tested before deployment and if it works fine then it has to be merged. It is a long manual process. To overcome this scenario, I have automated the entire process.

This repository contains all the commands that have been used to automate the process.
